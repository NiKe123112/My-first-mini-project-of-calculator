# Simple Calculator - Mini Project (Age 15)

This is my first mini Python project â€“ a simple calculator â€“ built at the age of 15 as part of my self-learning journey.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide
- Handles invalid inputs
- Prevents division by zero

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- Python 3

## ðŸŽ“ Purpose
I created this project to learn basic programming, logic building, and how to handle user input in Python. Itâ€™s a small step toward my future goal of studying Computer Science at a top university.

## ðŸ“¸ Screenshot
_Add a screenshot of your program running (optional)_

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Functions in Python
- `input()` and type conversion
- Conditional statements
- Error handling with `try` / `except`

## ðŸ“š Next Steps
- Add GUI (maybe with tkinter)
- Save history of calculations
- Build more Python projects!
